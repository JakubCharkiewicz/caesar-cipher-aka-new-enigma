Caesar Cipher Encryption

This Python script encrypts text using the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters (such as punctuation marks, spaces, and numbers) remain unchanged.

## How It Works

The script takes two inputs:

1. **`original_text`**: The text you want to encrypt.
2. **`shift_amount`**: The number of positions each letter in the text will be shifted in the alphabet.

For example, if `shift_amount` is 3:
- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- `Z` wraps around and becomes `C`

## Usage

To use the script, define your text and the shift amount.

```python
# Example usage
text = "Hello, World!"
shift = 3
output = khoor, zruog!
